# GET Requests

What happens when you type a URL into a browser and press enter? The browser sends a GET request to the server hosting the document that you're trying to access. A GET request can be thought of as your computer asking another computer (which is called a server) for all of the information that pertains to the webpage that you're trying to access. If the webpage contains multiple elements such as pictures or videos, your computer sends a GET request for each of those elements and they load as soon as your computer recieves them.
