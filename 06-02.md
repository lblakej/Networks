# Botnet

A botnet is an "army" of computers that have been infected with a virus. Whether through a fake program or phishing, when a computer gets a virus, it can be used by a hacker to contribute to a bigger goal. For the most part, botnets are used in DDoS attacks because it is an easy way to spam billions of requests.
