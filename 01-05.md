# How we send binary information

The way we send binary information is through the use of physical meidums that make use of electricity, lights and radio waves. We create a system of sending bits from one person to another using electricity. We clock the amount of time bits are used. Bandwidth is the maximum transmission capacity of a device which is the number of bits that we can send over a given period of time, usually measured in seconds.
