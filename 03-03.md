TCP

Transmission Control Protocal, or TCP, helps ensure that all data is delivered to your computer. Sometimes data is too complex to send in one file, so separate packages of data are sent to the device. After the requested data is recieved in from each package, TCP does inventory to verify all of the data has been recieved. If something is missing, TCP will not verify the data, and it will request the missing pieces to be resent. Once all of the requested information (a song, video, picture) is recieved and approved through TCP, it will show up on the device.
