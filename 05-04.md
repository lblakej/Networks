# Public and Private Key Encryption 

In public and private key encryption, a public key open to anyone is used to encrypt the data, but the only way to decrypt the data is with the matching private key, which is only distributed to those that are supposed to be able to see the decrypted information. The exclusivity of owning the matching private key is what provides the security and confidentiality of this system.
