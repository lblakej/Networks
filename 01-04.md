# Bandwidth

Bandwidth refers to the volume of information per unit of time that Internet connection can handle. Internet connection with larger bandwidth can move a video file, for example, much faster than internet connection with lower bandwith. It is measure in Mbps (bits per second). Larger bandwidth is almost always better, but how much you need depends on what you will be doing.  For example, if you have multiple TVs streaming Netflix, larger bandwidth is recommended.
