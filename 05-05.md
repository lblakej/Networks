# Caesar's Cipher and Algorithm

Caesar’s Cipher is a way in which we can encrypt messages so a person without the code cannot read the message. A basic description of Caesar’s Cipher is creating a password, such as 3, and then add or subtract three to every single letter in the message so “hello” will end up being “khoor”. However, because there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, it would be easy to try 0-26 and eventually crack the code. In response to this, an algorithm was developed which randomly generates a different number for every single letter in the message. Therefore, the “h” in “hello” could have a 7, the “e” could have a 2, etc. There is a 10 bit encryption which would leave the encrypted message with 10 billion possible key solutions or a 256 bit key encryption, which is impossible for even a computer to hack without the code. This is an extremely useful security tool for which we will continue to expand in the future.
