# Fiber Optic Cable 

A fiber optic cable consists of a thin glass threads, or fibers, in an insulated casing that allows for faster and longer data transfer and higher bandwidth. They work by shooting pulses of lights from either lasers or LEDs that pass through the cable. They can carry data longer distances than traditional copper cables since light can travel further without losing signal. [Fiber Optic Cable](https://www.lifewire.com/fiber-optic-cable-817874)
