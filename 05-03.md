# Encryption

Encryption is a process wherein information is encoded, hiding the original text so that outside parties are unable to decipher its meaning without access to the key or advanced decoding software. Encryption uses algorithms that turn information into symbols or text that can only be interpreted if transferred back into plaintext, or decrypted, thus making it inaccessible by potential interceptors.
