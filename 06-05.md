# Distributed Denial of Service Attacks

A Denial of Service (DOS) attack is a type of cyber weapon where hackers flood a website with access requests in order to overload the site's servers and cause it to crash. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is the same concept, but the access requests come from multiple computers, making it harder to trace and harder to control.
