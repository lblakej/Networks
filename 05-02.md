# Keys and 256 Bit Key

A key is something that only the sender and receiver know and it allows the reader to unlock an encrypted message. 

256 bit key is a modern, advanced encryption key with similar ideas to the Caesar's Cipher. It has a large key length of 256 bit and it encrypts messages and data. The reason it is so effective is that, because of it's large size, it would take millions of years for a modern day computer to test all of the possibilites for the key. As computers become faster, a larger key might be necessary.
